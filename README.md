# BST-Keyword-Search
Information retrieval systems allow users to enter keywords and retrieve articles that have those keywords associated with them.
For example, once a student named I wrote a paper called, Object Class Recognition using Images of Abstract Regions, and included the following keywords: object recognition, abstract regions, mixture models, and EM algorithm. If another person does a search for all articles about the EM algorithm, this paper (and many others) will be retrieved.
